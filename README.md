This project's objectives are 
- To become familiarized with the C programming language and compiling code
- To become familiarized with the shell / terminal / command-line of UNIX,
- To learn about how to implement data structures in C
- To learn a little about how UNIX utilities are implemented
- Optionally: To learn how to use a proper code editor, such as cLion (or emacs/nano or vi or kate...)
- To get an early insight into 2D array representations in memory in C

In this project, we implemented multiplying matrices, which aren't found in default Linux libraries. We wrote a program that multiplies matrices R = A * W + B where A is the input, W is called the weights matrix, and B is the bias. 
It prints out the resulting matrix R.
